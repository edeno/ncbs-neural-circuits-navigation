- Equations more uniformly formatted
- Generate PDFs with beamer

## Kernel Density Estimation

- Edge effects and how to deal with them
- Binning then KDE vs. KDE on raw data tradeoffs

## Point Process Time rescaling

- Misfit models of point processes: ISIs too long/short, missing covaraites

## Model Comparison

- Better explanation of AIC vs. Likelihood ratio test uses

## Spectral Analysis

- Fix expalantion of Fourier frequency bins vs. frequency resolution
