    "# Week 3c: Spike-Field Coupling, Phase-Based Measures, and Cross-Frequency Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the filtering, Hilbert transform, and coherence\n",
    "techniques from Weeks 3a–3b. There, we analyzed relationships *between LFP\n",
    "signals*. Now we ask three new questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Are LFP coherence measures reliable?** Coherence can be inflated by\n",
    "   volume conduction and common sources. We introduce alternative coupling\n",
    "   measures — Phase Locking Value (PLV) and Phase Lag Index (PLI) — that\n",
    "   address these issues.\n",
    "2. **How do spikes relate to LFP oscillations?** Neurons often fire at\n",
    "   preferred phases of ongoing rhythms like theta. We quantify this with\n",
    "   circular statistics, spike-field coherence, and harmonic Poisson regression.\n",
    "3. **How do different frequency bands interact?** Phase-amplitude coupling\n",
    "   (PAC) reveals cross-frequency organization, such as gamma bursts locked\n",
    "   to theta phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same dataset from Weeks 1–3b ([Petersen & Buzsáki, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442698/)),\n",
    "we combine spike times with LFP to study these relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the limitations of coherence (common sources, volume conduction)\n",
    "2. Compute and interpret Phase Locking Value (PLV) and Phase Lag Index (PLI)\n",
    "3. Construct phase tuning curves for spike-LFP relationships\n",
    "4. Apply circular statistics (circular mean, mean resultant length, Rayleigh test)\n",
    "5. Compute non-parametric spike-field coherence\n",
    "6. Build a harmonic Poisson regression model for spike-phase coupling\n",
    "7. Measure phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma"
